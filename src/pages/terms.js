        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">In order to use certain features of the Site and the App (e.g., to use the Services), you must register for an account with Slide (“Slide Account”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the applicable registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate and (b) you will provide us updates and maintain the accuracy of such information.

Slide cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</span></p>
        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.3wkjsshvcyzm" /><span className="c4 c0">1.3 Account Limitations</span></h5>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">We do not allow users to create multiple accounts using a single device. An individual who creates multiple accounts to earn Reward Points using Slide and Slide’s Friends Referral Program is considered to have breached Slide’s Advertising &amp; Use Terms, and Slide has the right to shut down his or her account. A user must use SIM card on his or her smartphone device. Slide won’t allow users to open their accounts, earn Reward Points and redeem their Reward Points on Slide. Slide is only available for use in the</span>

        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.dxzs9nl60omp" /><span className="c4 c0">2.1 Advertisements on Your Lockscreen; Earn Reward Points!</span></h5>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">When you download the App, Slide will display Contents and Advertisements on the lockscreen of your mobile phone. By moving the unlock ring to the engagement sign, and further engaging with the Advertisement, you will earn Reward Points. For example, if you watch a video advertisement, or download an App you will earn Reward Points. Each time you earn Reward Points, we place the Reward Points in your Slide Account. You can redeem your Reward Points as provided in Section 2.2. Some of the Advertisements may be subject to additional terms and you agree to abide by those terms. The determination of what Advertisements you see, whether you have earned any Reward Points and what products and services you may receive by redeeming your Reward Points will be made entirely by us – and we do not guarantee that you will receive any Advertisements or Reward Points.</span></p>
        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.q50zq4z7t212" /><span className="c4 c0">2.2 Redeeming Reward Points</span></h5>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">When your Slide Account has accumulated Reward Points, you can go to the Slide’s Redeem menu within the Services and redeem the Reward Points. While we reserve the right to modify the way that you can redeem Reward Points, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, you can redeem your Reward Points by going to the part of the Services called the Redeem (the “Redeem”). At the Redeem, you can purchase Free Talk Time, pay your bills with participating merchants, or make a distribution to one of our partner charities listed within the Redeem. The Reward Points remain the property of Slide, not you, at all times prior to the time that you successfully redeem your Reward Points through the Services. We may elect to invalidate any Reward Points at our discretion and if we do so, you will no longer be able to redeem them. Please note that the term “P” used in this Agreement (other than in Section 10) refer to units of Reward Points and not to any actual currency or legal tender.</span></p>

        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">If you elect to close your Slide Account, or if we terminate your Slide Account because you breach Slide’s Advertising &amp; Use Terms, we may elect to invalidate those Reward Points and you will no longer be able to redeem your remaining Reward Points.</span></p>
        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.r3b3ub4f26cg" /><span className="c4 c0">2.4 Taxes</span></h5>

        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.odgv50oc4l2c" /><span className="c4 c0">2.5 Inactivity; Escheat Laws</span></h5>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">We value your continued participation in our Service. If, however, your Slide Account is inactive for an extended period of time, we may be required to remit the value of the Reward Points in your Slide Account to the state which you reported to us as the state you last resided in. If we remit funds as required by law, you will need to contact the state, and not us, to obtain the balance of money in your Slide Account.</span></p>
        <h5 className="c1"><a name="h.cd7e1pkx29cb" /><span className="c4 c0">2.6 Expiration of Reward Points</span></h5>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">Reward Points are not your personal property, and are not descendible, may not be inherited, bartered or sold to any third party, and may not be transferred. Your earned Reward Points shall expire on the earlier of: (a) the date six (6) months from when you earned the Reward Points; or (b) when your Slide user account is deleted or terminated.

        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and 42Company Inc. or 42Company, Inc.’s employees, agents, successors, or assigns, will exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.</span></p>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</span></p>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">You and 42Company, Inc. must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR 42Company, Inc. MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, 42Company, Inc. will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) 42Company, Inc. also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (h) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.</span></p>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either You or 42Company, Inc. may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret will not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims will be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Seoul, Korea. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Seoul, Korea in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Seoul, Korea for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</span></p>
        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither You nor Slide will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Seoul, Korea.</span></p>

        <p className="c3"><span className="c0">This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site, App, and Services.
